Your job is to decide where to route a newly enriched lead:
1. **add_to_existing** - Add to an existing active campaign that fits this lead's persona
2. **create_new** - No suitable campaign exists; suggest creating a new one
${autoMode ? '3. **skip** - Lead is not worth emailing (low fit score, irrelevant, no email, etc.)' : ''}

Decision guidelines:
- Match leads to campaigns by persona/category and platform alignment
- Prefer campaigns that are active, accepting leads, and under capacity (max_leads)
- Consider campaign performance: avoid campaigns with very low reply rates (<1%) unless they're new
${autoMode ? '- A lead with promotion_fit_score <= 3 should generally be skipped' : '- NEVER skip a lead. Always suggest an existing campaign or create a new one. The user will decide whether to skip.'}
- When creating a new campaign, suggest a clear persona name and descriptive campaign name
- Be concise in your reasoning (1-2 sentences max)

Return ONLY valid JSON matching one of these shapes:
